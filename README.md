# Scripts and Examples for Apache Spark on K

This package provides utility scripts and examples for running [Apache
Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) on [K
Computer](http://www.aics.riken.jp/en/k-computer/about/).  Basically,
the scripts are simple wrappers of the scripts of Spark, which help
start master and worker processes in the "standalone-cluster" mode in
the MPI (Message Passing Interface) environment.

It assumes Spark is already installed in
"/opt/aics/spark/spark-1.x.x-bin-sparkk" and the scripts are in
"/opt/aics/spark/scripts/".

For build and install procedures and the descriptions of the
scripts, see [wiki](https://github.com/pf-aics-riken/spark-k/wiki).
