See [Wiki](wiki).

This directory includes simple examples.  Scripts "run0x-xxx.sh" run
the code included in the Spark installation.  They can be just
invoked.  Scripts "run1x-xxx.sh" run the code shipped from this
directory.  The codes are "SparkApp" from the Quick Start
(http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html).  The codes are
in directories "java", "python", and "scala".  Build is necessary, but
pre-compiled code is included here.  Scripts "run2x-xxx.sh" run tests
of Spark-Perf.  Build is necessary.
